## Built With

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) - A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) - An ORM that can run in Node.js and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8).
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - An open-source relational database management system.

## Structure

The project has the following modules:

1. `AppModule`: The root module of the application. It initializes the TypeORM connection and imports the User and Post modules.
2. `UsersModule`: Handles all user-related functionality. It sets up the TypeORM connection specifically for the User and Profile entities.
3. `PostModule`: Handles post-related functionality. It sets up the TypeORM connection specifically for the Post entity.
